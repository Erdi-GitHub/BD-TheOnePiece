# TheOnePiece
A simple BetterDiscord plugin that plays the iconic meme song "the one piece is real" when a message contains "the one piece is real" or "can we get much higher"
Once it starts playing, the message that triggered it to play turns yellow until the sound stops playing

To manually stop the song, you can press the pause button or the scrubber.
